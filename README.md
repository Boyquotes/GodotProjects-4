# GodotProjects

<h2>
  Hey you lovely lurker!
</h2>
<p>
  If you are looking for something to evaluate my programming skills, I warn you things might be slightly more messy around here than my bigger project repos. However, if you are specifically looking for my GDScripts, this might be the only place while I am keeping the bigger stuff behind the curtains.
  
  If you are just "lookin' around", you might find something interesting in these folders :)

  This repository contains all of my insignificant Godot projects and prototypes.
  This is just for me to have easy access when I work on many computers.
  And for you to do whatever you wish :)
